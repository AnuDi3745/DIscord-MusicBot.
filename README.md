Hii! My name is Anish Dhane.
This is my rally simple but efficient music bot for discord.
Using is is really easy just follow some steps:
1)Make a new application as a bot in https://discord.com/developers/applications
2)Install ffmpeg in your pc from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows
3)Install the following using cmd in the directory where you are gonna store the bot python file:
  a)Install Discord.py by typing pip install discord 
  b)Install Pynacl by typing pip install pynacl
  c)Install youtube_dl by typing pip install youtube_dl 
4)Make a python file and refer my code to do yours!!
5)In bot section of discord's developers site,You'll find a token copy it and paste it on the last line code i.e. client.run(paste your token here in ' ')
6)In oAuth2 section of discord's developers site, select the bot role and admin role and copy the path provided.
7)Paste that link in your browser and add it in your server.
